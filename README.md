Project was designed to automate invoices downloading and uploading to google drive.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.8

## Status
In minor development.
Most of things that were necessary for script to do it's job is already done.
I will probably work on making some unit tests.
Some bug fixes and reworks might be done as i gain more experience in python.
As well as some stuff marked as TODO, that is not critical for scrip to work.
