Project was designed to automate invoices downloading and uploading to google drive.

## Technologies

## Status
In minor development.\
Most of the things that were necessary for script to work is already done.\
I will probably work on making unit tests. Just to learn how to make them.\
Reworks might be done as I gain more experience in python.\
As well as some stuff marked as TODO, that is not critical for script to work.
